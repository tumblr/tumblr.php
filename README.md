[![CI](https://github.com/tumblr/tumblr.php/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tumblr/tumblr.php/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

The official PHP client for the [Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2).

## Usage

### Authentication

This client allows you to use one of these authentication levels:

- API key
- OAuth

Using API key, the simplest one, you just need to set the client with you Consumer Key, provided by [Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps), like this
``` php
$client = new Tumblr\API\Client($consumerKey);
```
for use methods which are accessible from the API key. E.g.
``` php
$client->getBlogInfo($blogName);
```
The OAuth level is a little more complex, because it gives more access to user account. You need tokens which are provided only by user authorization. To obtain these tokens, first you need to:

- Guarantee that your application credentials are valid
- Tell which page should the user return to
- Redirect user to the Tumblr authorization page

So let's consider you are coding the page `https://example.com/auth/tumblr`. You must configure your client with your application credentials, provided by [OAuth](https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps)
``` php
$client = new Tumblr\API\Client($consumerKey, $consumerSecret);
```
Point the request handler to Tumblr
``` php
$requestHandler = $client->getRequestHandler();
$requestHandler->setBaseUrl('https://www.tumblr.com/');
```
And then send the request to Tumblr with your callback URL. Let's consider it would be `https://example.com/auth/tumblr/callback`.
``` php
$response = $requestHandler->request('POST', 'oauth/request_token', [
    'oauth_callback' => 'https://example.com/auth/tumblr/callback'
]);
```
If your credentials are valid, you should receive temporary tokens to continue. You may extract them this way
``` php
parse_str((string) $response->body, $tokens);
```
`$tokens` will contain
``` php
['oauth_token' => '...', 'oauth_token_secret' => '...']
```
Save these tokens somehow (e.g. using `$_SESSION`), because we're going to use them in the next session. Now, the user must be redirected to URL `https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token={$tokens['oauth_token']}`.

Now, the user should decide if authorizes your application and then should be redirected to your callback page with 'get' param `oauth_verifier`. Now let's consider you're coding the page `https://example.com/auth/tumblr/callback`. One more time you should set the client with your application credentials and termporary tokens stored in the last session.
``` php
$client = new Tumblr\API\Client($consumerKey, $consumerSecret, $oauthToken, $oauthTokenSecret);
```
Again let's point the request handler to Tumblr
``` php
$requestHandler = $client->getRequestHandler();
$requestHandler->setBaseUrl('https://www.tumblr.com/');
```
And send the request to Tumblr with param `oauth_verifier`, at this time receiving the definitive tokens
``` php
$response = $requestHandler->request('POST', 'oauth/access_token', [
    'oauth_verifier' => $oauthVerifier
]);
```
You can also use the variable `$_GET` to recover `$oauthVerifier`.

If everything runs correctly, you should receive the definitive tokens, which may be extracted this way
``` php
parse_str((string) $response->body, $tokens);
```
Remember: you can verify the response status with `$response->status`. If everything runs correctly, the status will be `200`. Otherwise, will be `401`. You can see all status [here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).

Finally, you can use any method provided by client.
``` php
$client = new Tumblr\API\Client($consumerKey, $consumerSecret, $oauthToken, $oauthTokenSecret);
$client->getUserInfo();
```

### User Methods

``` php
$client->getUserInfo();

$client->getDashboardPosts($options = null);
$client->getLikedPosts($options = null);
$client->getFollowedBlogs($options = null);

$client->follow($blogName);
$client->unfollow($blogName);

$client->like($postId, $reblogKey);
$client->unlike($postId, $reblogKey);
```

### Blog Methods

``` php
$client->getBlogInfo($blogName);

$client->getBlogAvatar($blogName, $size = null);

$client->getBlogPosts($blogName, $options = null);
$client->getBlogLikes($blogName, $options = null);
$client->getBlogFollowers($blogName, $options = null);

$client->getQueuedPosts($blogName, $options = null);
$client->getDraftPosts($blogName, $options = null);
$client->getSubmissionPosts($blogName, $options = null);
```

### Post Methods

``` php
$client->createPost($blogName, $data);
$client->editPost($blogName, $id, $data);
$client->deletePost($blogName, $id, $reblogKey);
$client->reblogPost($blogName, $id, $reblogKey, $options = null);
```

### Tagged Methods

``` php
$client->getTaggedPosts($tag, $options = null);
```
